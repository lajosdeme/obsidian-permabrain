# Obisidan Permabrain

A simple plugin that allows you to back up your vault on Arweave as a zip archive.

To use this plugin you must have an Arweave wallet with some AR tokens in it.

**Note**: Permabrain uploads your vault as a zip archive **without encryption** or **password protection**. 
I will add the option to encrypt/password protect the zip archive when I have some free time to spend on this.
Otherwise, feel free to submit a PR if you'd like to do this.

Features:  
✅ Upload vault to Arweave in zip format  
❌ Encrypt the zip archive
